## Project Objective

To provide a donor-focused report showcasing the **coverage**, **trends**, and **gaps** in child protection services.  
Despite the conflict in Sudan, protection activities continued in accessible states, reflecting a real-world humanitarian data context.

---

## Executive Summary

This project simulates a real-world donor report to demonstrate how **SQL** and **Power BI** can be used to track child protection services, referrals, and partner performance in a humanitarian setting.

Developed in response to operational challenges in Sudan, the project models monthly reporting workflows and visualizes service coverage across states, sectors, and vulnerable groups. I led the full data pipeline—from relational database modeling and SQL querying to Power BI dashboard design—showing how data can inform decision-making for donors and coordination actors even in crisis contexts.

---

## Methodology

- **Data Simulation:**  
  Fictional data generated to reflect real-world protection case management scenarios.

- **Data Sources:**  
  Simulated partner submissions, based on ActivityInfo-style indicators.

- **Tools Used:**
  - **SQL** – For querying protection case data, referrals, and service trends.  
  - **Power BI** – For dashboard creation and visual storytelling.  
  - **Excel** – For data preparation and structure simulation.

- **Data Cleaning & Shaping:**  
  Power Query was used within Power BI to clean and transform the dataset.

- **Calculation Logic:**  
  DAX measures were created for dynamic KPIs like referral aging and overdue case tracking.

## Dashboard Interpretation

### Program Coverage Summary  
🧭 This view gives a high-level overview of how child protection cases are progressing. 
Most cases are currently in the assessment phase, with fewer reaching follow-up or closure.

The breakdown by sex and case status highlights a concerning number of open cases among boys, suggesting possible delays in follow-up or case resolution.

---

### Case Management Tracking  
📌 This section shows the status of cases managed by each partner, with most cases marked as in progress or pending.

The table highlights partner presence by state, helping to identify geographic gaps in service delivery.

The final chart outlines specific needs, with a large number of children identified as street children, making it the most frequently reported vulnerability.

---

### Key Performance Indicators  
📈 Summarizes delivery performance.  
Flags:  
This section highlights key service delivery metrics. The dashboard shows:

5 pending referrals,

3 overdue cases (pending for more than 5 days),

12.5% of planned services delivered for IDPs in Blue Nile.


These indicators point to delays in referral follow-up and low service coverage in a high-priority area.

## SQL Analysis Overview

- **Basic Queries (`01_basic_queries.sql`):**
  - Referral counts by status and partner  
  - Service distribution by location  
  - Partner-wise beneficiary reach

- **Advanced Queries (`02_advanced_queries.sql`):**
  - Window functions: `DENSE_RANK()`, `LAG()`, `NTILE()`  
  - Rolling referral counts: `COUNT() OVER()`  
  - Referral aging using `DATEDIFF()` and conditions

|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🔴 High number of pending referrals in Blue Nile       | Prioritize follow-up and provide targeted support to partners operating in Blue Nile  |
| 🟠 Most cases remain in progress or pending            | Strengthen partner case management capacity and improve follow-up mechanisms          |
| 🟠 3 referrals pending for over 5 days                 | Introduce response time benchmarks and set up alerts for overdue cases                |
| 🔵 Street children are the most reported vulnerability | Ensure appropriate services are available and strengthen outreach for this group      |
| 🔵 Limited partner coverage and service diversity      | Expand partner presence or offer cross-sector training to fill service gaps           |
